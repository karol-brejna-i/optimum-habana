This is an example script for optimum habana project, with command to run lm_eval tasks. I would like to be able to run a task (for example "piqa") but with overriden/changed dataset path (it is possible to do so lm-eval-harness project...).

<<todo: quote/addd to context repro.sh >>

It uses optimum-habana/examples/text-generation/run_lm_eval.py script to do the job. 

Gather knowledge from:
- https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/interface.md
- https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/docs/new_task_guide.md
- https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/blob/main/lm_eval/evaluator.py

I would like a solution where I could specify the task and associated (non default) dataset path in the --task switch.
For example, `--task piqa` would use default dataset path for the dask, while `--task piqa:karol/piqa` would use 'karol/piqa' instead'
